/**
 * Turns each sheet of the compiled NERC workbook into a reporting Dataset:
 * a downloadable XLSX template, the fields behind it, and the obligation
 * telling a given institution to file it for a given period.
 *
 * One sheet = one Dataset. The workbook is NERC's own reporting
 * requirement, so NERC owns every dataset definition and files it:
 * - the 10 DisCo sheets are filed by NERC as one consolidated,
 *   NERC_CONSOLIDATED submission per period, covering all 12 DisCos in a
 *   single multi-row template (Discos/Date/Year/Month_Name identifier
 *   columns plus the sheet's measure columns) - mirroring the raw NERC
 *   workbook's own layout, since NERC is the one compiling this data.
 * - the 2 GenCo sheets are filed by NISO / TCN, the system operator that
 *   reports generation, one PER_INSTITUTION obligation per period as before.
 *
 * Field selection for PER_INSTITUTION datasets follows from what an
 * obligation already pins: institution x dataset x reporting period, so no
 * Disco/Year/Month columns are asked for, only the measures. For
 * NERC_CONSOLIDATED datasets those identifier columns are added back onto
 * the template by dataset-template.ts, since one file now covers many
 * institutions and periods. Where a sheet varies *within* one institution
 * and period, that dimension becomes its own field: "Disco Metering" splits
 * by Customer_Type, so it asks for metered and unmetered counts separately.
 *
 * The two GenCo sheets are per-plant in the source workbook, which a
 * single-row obligation template cannot hold. They are defined here as the
 * national totals the KPIs actually consume (M300-P1-002, M300-P1-016) -
 * the same figures ingest-nerc-genco-kpis.ts derives by summing/averaging
 * plants. Per-plant detail stays with the bulk workbook import; it is not
 * something this per-institution manual-entry path collects.
 *
 * Each field is linked to the KPI its value ultimately feeds, so an
 * approved submission flows through to the dashboards rather than sitting
 * in a table nobody reads.
 *
 * Obligations are created for the most recently *closed* period only, at
 * each dataset's own cadence - the period a filer would actually be working
 * on now. Earlier periods are deliberately not generated: the historical
 * figures already arrived through the bulk workbook import, and back-filling
 * obligations for them would post years of overdue notices for returns
 * nobody is going to file through this platform retrospectively.
 *
 * A consequence worth knowing: the monthly datasets land as "due" (the
 * month just closed), while the quarterly and annual ones land as overdue,
 * because their deadlines genuinely passed before the platform was carrying
 * them. That is an accurate reflection of what has not been filed here, not
 * a seeding artefact.
 *
 * Idempotent: datasets upsert by deterministic id, fields are replaced, and
 * obligations upsert on the (institution, dataset, period) unique key.
 *
 * Run with: DATABASE_URL=... node dist/prisma/ingest-nerc-datasets-obligations.js
